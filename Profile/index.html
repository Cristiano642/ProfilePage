                    <h1>About me:</h1>
                    <p>I am a professional with experience in management and leadership in different areas, from
                        catering to security. For 9 years, I worked in various coffee shops in the Lisbon Metro, where I
                        started as an operator and quickly climbed the career ladder until I became manager of some
                        stores after 2 years. Then I moved to the security area, where I worked for 4 years, 2 of them
                        as group leader.</p>
                    <p>I am a dynamic, responsible and communicative person who likes to work in a team and face new
                        challenges. I am also a self-proclaimed nerd who loves Star Wars and Dragon Ball (I will shout
                        Kamehameha with my heart), Marvel and DC Comics (I can’t choose between the two). That’s why I
                        decided to take a risk and change my life by diving into the programming area with Academia de
                        Código, which provides intensive training in the art of programming. I am part of the
                        “PowRangers” class, which is as powerful as the original Power Rangers (but without the colorful
                        suits). Our motto is “POW POW POW POW”, which means that we give our best in every line of code
                        we write (and also because it’s fun to say).</p>
                    <p>I am ready to use the Force of my code to fight the dark side of bugs and create amazing
                        applications that make the world better (or at least more fun). As Spider-Man would say: “With
                        great power comes great responsibility”. And as Batman would say: “I’m Batman”. But don’t worry,
                        I won’t go around dressed as a bat or shooting webs through buildings. Unless you ask me.”</p>
