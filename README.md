# My personal page

Hello, 

I’m Cristiano and this is my personal page on github. I created this project to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and also to show some of my work and interests. I’m still improving my code and the design of the page, but I hope you like what I’ve done so far.

# How to use
